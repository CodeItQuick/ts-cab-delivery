Retro (w/ Mojo and CodeItQuick Feb 1st, 2025):
**Observations**
1. TDD feels safe
2. TDD is faster? maybe: we coded fast/it appeared to be faster
3. Learn the "business logic" portion of TDD (no domain tests in here yet)
4. Fix a bug vs create a brand new feature/functionality
5. Tests first? What should the scope of the test be?
6. Explore Lower layer would be fun
